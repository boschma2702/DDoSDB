\section{Related Work}
Fallahi et. al. \cite{Fallahi2016} implemented automatic rule generation for the SIDS Snort. They used two data mining algorithms called Ripper and C5.0. They investigated five types of attacks and tested it on the ISCX 2012 dataset. Rather than looking to indivual packets, they looked at the flow of data.

Fouda \cite{Fouda2017} proposes a payload based signature generation specific for DDoS attacks. The generated signatures were as new rules to Snort.
