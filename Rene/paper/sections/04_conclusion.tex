\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusion}
In this paper, we investigated whether Bro is capable of detecting attacks with automated generated rules based on the signatures retrieved from DDoSDB. We first show that it is possible for the selected attack vectors to automatically generate Bro signature within 4.2 milliseconds. Secondly, we executed an experiment in which we replayed various attack vectors on a common network architecture to which we added a switch which supports port mirroring. From these experiments, we conclude that Bro is capable of detecting and responding to all attacks within 0.31 milliseconds when only one signature is active and within 0.7 milliseconds with all our generated signatures active. From this, we conclude that Bro does not increase dramatically in response time when more signatures are added. 

For future work, we intend to investigate the accuracy of the automatically generated rules when applied to traffic which includes both normal and malicious traffic. There is some place for improvement on the investigation of the limit number of signatures Bro is able to handle.
