\section{Planning tasks}\label{sec:planning}
In this section, we will briefly discuss the planning of the research. Figure \ref{fig:planning} pictures the intended planning. The first 7 weeks are planned for writing the proposal. This period knows two deadlines at the end of week 14 and 16. The first deadline is the deadline for the draft proposal and the second the deadline for the final proposal. During this period not that much time can be spent on the actual research due to other obligations. 

The remaining of the time the actual research will be carried out. During this period, more time can be spent per week in comparison to the proposal period. The research period is defined in time per RQ. The first and last RQs are more theory based and therefore probably cost less time than RQ 2 which is more practical. During RQ 3 there is also a holiday planned where no time will be spent on this research. 

Finally, a week to finalize the entire research is planned. This period is intended as a buffer in case some parts of the research are going less prosperous than intended.
